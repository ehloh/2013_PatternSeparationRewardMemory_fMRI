Notes re scripting in Linux


# If constructing SubjList manually in vi, the total n characters should be N subjects x 7 for a 6-character subject ID (i.e. only 1 extra character per subject). Any more indicates there are probably other invisible characters that will mess things up. 


Instructions for vi:
- vi TextFile.txt = opens up document TextFile.txt. If it doesn't exist, will create it.
- i= insert
- Esc = Exit current command, e.g. insert (some don't need)
- x = delete character
- o = open a new line below where cursor is
- dd = delete whole line
- ":" (colon) = command function (for single-letter commands in editing)
- :h = help
- :q = quit (command window, or help window)
- :q! = quit without saving
- :w = write/save


# All structural and contrast images must be in .nii format. 

# Sometime in the future, figure out how to read SubjName from txt file in a way that disregards trailing/invisible/unintended characters like /r, or indexes only the first x characters. Otherwise, subject lists must be manually constructed in Linux using vi, so as to avoid (invisible) line reads/returns which will show up as /r in the terminal. SubjName display format below (edged by #s) aims to flag such trailing characters if they are present.

# Remember, ingoing contrasts for adjustment must NOT have been normalized. All other preprocessing steps ok.
